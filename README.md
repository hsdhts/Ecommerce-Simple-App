# Authentications

This service utilizes token-based authentication, requiring users to have an account for accessing its features. If you don't have an account, please create a new one. Once registered, you can generate an authentication token. This token serves as a means of logging in, requiring you to authenticate yourself using your email and password. If the authentication is successful, you will receive an access token, enabling you to access the service. If the authentication fails, an error message will be displayed.

The provided tokens are the accessToken. The accessToken remains valid for one hour.
By following this authentication process, you can securely access the service and enjoy its functionalities.
